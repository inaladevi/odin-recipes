            <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
                <p><strong>Paneer quality:</strong> Use fresh, firm paneer to avoid it breaking while cooking.</p>
                <p><strong>Cooking masala:</strong> Cook the onion-tomato paste well to remove raw flavors and get a smooth
                    gravy.</p>
                <p><strong>Spice balance:</strong> Adjust chili and garam masala according to taste, but follow the recipe for
                    authentic flavor.</p>
                <p><strong>Simmer gently:</strong> Keep the gravy on low heat once paneer is added to prevent curdling or
                    sticking.</p>
                <p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice for the best experience.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Storage tip:</strong> Leftovers can be refrigerated for 1-2 days. Reheat gently on low heat with a
                    splash of cream.</p>
