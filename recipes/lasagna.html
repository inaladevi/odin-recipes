        <!-- Fun Fact / History -->
        <aside>
            <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
            <p>Lasagna's origins trace back to Ancient Greece, where a dish called <em>laganon</em> consisted of layers of pasta
                dough. The term evolved through Latin as <em>lasanum</em>, meaning 'cooking pot'. By the Middle Ages, the dish
                had transformed into a layered pasta bake, with the earliest recorded recipe appearing in the 14th-century
                manuscript <em>Liber de Coquina</em>.</p>
            <p>In Naples, Italy, during the Middle Ages, lasagna became a celebratory dish, often prepared for special
                occasions. The modern version, featuring layers of pasta, cheese, and tomato sauce, emerged over time and has
                become a beloved comfort food worldwide.</p>

            <p>
                Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan over medium heat. Add diced carrots, zucchini, and red capsicum. Saut√© until
                slightly tender but still crisp. Remove from heat and set aside.

                In the same pan, add the chopped spinach and cook until wilted. Combine with the saut√©ed vegetables
                in a mixing bowl.
