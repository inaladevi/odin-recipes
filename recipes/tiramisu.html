        <!-- Fun Fact / History -->
        <aside class="fun-fact-section">
            <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
            <p>The exact origin of Tiramisu is a subject of debate between Italy's Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions. One
                widely accepted story attributes its creation to the late 1960s at <em>Le Beccherie</em> in Treviso, Veneto.
                Chef Roberto "Loli" Linguanotto accidentally combined mascarpone cheese with egg yolks and sugar, leading to the
                creation of this iconic dessert. The name "Tiramisu," meaning "pick me up" in Italian, refers to the energizing
                effects of its ingredients like coffee and cocoa.</p>
            <p>Another claim comes from Friuli-Venezia Giulia, where a dessert called "Tirimes√π" was served as early as 1938 at
                the <em>Vetturino</em> restaurant in Pieris. This version, however, was a semi-frozen mousse with chocolate and
                Marsala wine, differing from the modern Tiramisu we know today.</p>
            <p>Despite these competing claims, Tiramisu gained international fame in the 1980s and remains a beloved dessert
                worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
        
            <!-- Step 1: Prepare the Mascarpone Cream -->
            <h3>Step 1: Whip the Mascarpone Cream</h3>
            <img src="../images/tiramisu/whipped-mascarpone.jpg" alt="Whipping mascarpone cream">
            <p>
                In a large bowl, combine mascarpone cheese, heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract. Whip until smooth
                and
                creamy, with soft peaks forming. This will be the luscious filling for your tiramisu.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 2: Prepare Coffee Soak -->
            <h3>Step 2: Brew Coffee and Soak Ladyfingers</h3>
            <p>
                Brew strong coffee and let it cool. Add coffee liqueur or rum if desired. Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the
                coffee,
                making sure they absorb some liquid but do not become soggy.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 3: Layer the Ladyfingers -->
            <h3>Step 3: Lay the Ladyfingers</h3>
            <img src="../images/tiramisu/ladyfinger-laying.webp" alt="Laying dipped ladyfingers">
            <p>
                Arrange the dipped ladyfingers in a single layer at the base of your serving dish or pan. Ensure they fit snugly
                and form
                a solid base for the cream.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 4: Spread Mascarpone Cream -->
            <h3>Step 4: Spread Mascarpone Cream</h3>
            <img src="../images/tiramisu/spreading-mascarpone.jpg" alt="Spreading mascarpone cream over ladyfingers">
            <p>
                Evenly spread a generous layer of the whipped mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers. Smooth the surface with a
                spatula.
                Repeat with a second layer of dipped ladyfingers and cream if desired.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 5: Dust with Cocoa -->
            <h3>Step 5: Dust with Cocoa Powder</h3>
            <img src="../images/tiramisu/tiramisu-dusting.jpg" alt="Dusting tiramisu with cocoa powder">
            <p>
                Lightly sift unsweetened cocoa powder over the top layer of mascarpone cream. This gives the classic tiramisu
                look
                and a touch of rich chocolate flavor.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 6: Serve -->
            <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
            <img src="../images/tiramisu/tiramisu-serve.jpg" alt="Serving eggless tiramisu">
            <p>
                Chill the tiramisu in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before serving to let the flavors meld. Cut into
                squares
                and enjoy your creamy, eggless Italian dessert!

        <section class="recipe-notes-section">
            <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
                <p><strong>Coffee soak:</strong> Dip the ladyfingers quickly to avoid sogginess. They should absorb some liquid
                    but still hold shape.</p>
                <p><strong>Chilling time:</strong> Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably 4‚Äì6, so the flavors meld and
                    the dessert sets properly.</p>
                <p><strong>Mascarpone cream:</strong> Whip just until soft peaks form. Over-whipping can make the cream grainy.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Cocoa dusting:</strong> Sift cocoa powder right before serving to keep it fresh and vibrant.</li>
                <p><strong>Layering tip:</strong> Ensure even layers of ladyfingers and cream for a balanced texture and flavor
                    in every bite.</p>
                <p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Cut into squares and serve chilled with a side of fresh berries or a
                    drizzle of chocolate sauce if desired.</p>
