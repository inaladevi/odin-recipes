        <!-- Fun Fact / History -->
        <aside>
            <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
            <p>Hyderabadi biryani first appeared in the royal kitchens of the Nizams in the 18th century.
                Royals would seal layers of marinated meat and rice with dough and cook it slowly (‚Äúdum‚Äù) a method that locks in
                flavors and makes the biryani tender and aromatic.
                Today, this dum-style remains a defining characteristic of the dish in Hyderabad.</p>

            <h2>Preparation</h2>
        
            <!-- Step 1: Marination -->
            <h3>Step 1: Marinate the Chicken</h3>
            <img src="../images/biryani/marination.jpg" alt="Chicken marination" width="450">
            <p>
                In a large bowl, combine chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, chili powder, turmeric,
                garam masala, lemon juice, salt, slit green chilies, mint, coriander, and 2 Tbsp pre-fried onions.
                Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (overnight for best flavor).
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 2: Fry the Onions (Birista) -->
            <h3>Step 2: Prepare the Fried Onions (Birista)</h3>
            <p>
                Heat ghee or oil in a deep pan. Add thinly sliced onions and fry on medium heat, stirring often,
                until deep golden brown and crisp. Remove and drain on paper towels. These will be used in
                both marination and layering.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 3: Cooking the Rice -->
            <h3>Step 3: Cook the Rice</h3>
            <img src="../images/biryani/basmati-rice-cooking.jpg" alt="Cooking basmati rice" width="600">
            <p>
                Rinse the basmati rice until the water runs clear. Bring 4 cups water to a boil with salt, bay leaf,
                cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, and 1 tsp oil/ghee. Add rice and cook until 70% done
                (the grains should still have a bite). Drain immediately to stop cooking.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 4: Layering -->
            <h3>Step 4: Layer the Biryani</h3>
            <img src="../images/biryani/layering-biryani.jpg" alt="Layering the biryani" width="450">
            <p>
                In a heavy-bottomed pot, spread the marinated chicken evenly at the base. Add half the cooked rice
                on top, then sprinkle mint, coriander, fried onions, saffron milk, and ghee. Repeat with the
                remaining rice and toppings.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 5: Sealing & Dum Cooking -->
            <h3>Step 5: Seal and Dum Cook</h3>
            <img src="../images/biryani/sealing-with-foil.webp" alt="Sealing the biryani pot with foil" width="500">
            <p>
                Cover the pot with foil and a tight-fitting lid to trap steam. Place over medium heat for 5 minutes,
                then reduce to low and cook for 25-30 minutes (dum method). The steam will gently cook the
                chicken and infuse the rice with rich flavors.
            </p>
        
            <!-- Step 6: Serve -->
            <h3>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3>
            <img src="../images/biryani/serving.jpg" alt="Serving Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani" width="450">
            <p>
                Rest the biryani for 10 minutes before opening the lid. Gently fluff the layers with a spatula,
                keeping the rice grains intact. Serve hot with raita, salad, or mirchi ka salan.
            </p>

                <h2>Recipe Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rice quality matters:</strong> Use aged basmati rice for that perfect, fluffy texture and long
                        grains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marination time:</strong> For best flavor, marinate the chicken for at least 1 hour, overnight is
                        even better.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fried onions tip:</strong> Fry the onions on medium heat for even browning. Burnt onions can turn
                        the biryani bitter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dum cooking:</strong> Keep the heat low during the final steam stage to avoid burning the bottom
                        layer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Saffron alternative:</strong> If saffron isn't available, a pinch of turmeric in warm milk can give
                        a similar golden hue.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resting time:</strong> Let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before serving so the flavors blend
                        beautifully.</li>
                </ul>
